# project2-th-rjs
## Project Description
​A simple turn-based role-playing game that will allow users to create their own character to battle with other players or npcs. Users will be able to choose from a variety of cosmetic customization options as well as stat allocation upon creation, which will let players define their own playstyle. Players can then take their character to the battlefield and fight for points and additional rewards.
